# Introduction

This repository contains the Matlab scripts and data for Figures presented in the article:

> INSERT ARTICLE BIBLIOGRAPHY WHEN PUBLISHED

In that article, we overview a signal processing representation called the **modulation spectrum**. This representation quantifies the **rate-of-change** of different spectral magnitude components and is shown to separate signal from noise, thus allowing for improved quality measurement, quality enhancement, and
noise-robust feature extraction, as well as for disease characterization.

## Requirements
The scripts in this repository require:

1. **Amplitude Modulation Analysis Toolbox**  
  Contains funtions to compute the modulation spectrogram  
  [https://github.com/MuSAELab/amplitude-modulation-analysis-matlab](https://github.com/MuSAELab/amplitude-modulation-analysis-matlab)

2. **MatPlotLib Perceptually Uniform Colormaps**
  Contans the `inferno` colormap that was used for the figures
